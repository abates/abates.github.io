        <h1>A City in Distress</h1>
        <p>Carter's Gas Station is a privately-owned station and mini-mart just off the ICC (inter-
        county connector) in the Red Rock City section called North Riverside. North Riverside
        is just on the periphery of Downtown Red Rock City and sandwiched between the ICC to
        the south, Red Rock River to the east and Morningwood to the north.</p>

        <p>Riverside used to be a middle-class neighborhood surrounded by well-kept parks and
        friendly, locally-owned shops along Riverside Avenue. Now, with closures to the
        factories in Red Rock City, Riverside Avenue businesses are more likely to be boarded
        up. Pressure from big box stores in the suburbs, high unemployment, and urban flight
        have contributed to erode the neighborhood. The ICC bisected Riverside into North
        Riverside and South Riverside.</p>

        <p>When Red Rock City went into bankruptcy several years ago, street repair work on the
        ICC underpass sidewalks was abandoned, further bifurcating Riverside. Now, car or bus
        is the only means to safely navigate from North to South.</p>
